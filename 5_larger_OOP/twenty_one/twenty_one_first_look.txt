Twenty-one is a game in which a player and a dealer are dealt 2-card hands from a shuffled
deck, with each player given the option to add additional cards or stop adding
cards. The winner has the hand that is closest to a point value of 21 without
going over that value.

Notes:
- Table handles the display, messaging, and scoring (too much?)
- If the deck handles the 'dealing' part, the dealer is essentially just another
  player, the difference being that the dealer has a strategy and has a hidden
  card. possibly Dealer < Player or they shared a base class
- possibly display module, possibly notifier module for all messaging
