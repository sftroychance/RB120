Rock Paper Scissors - OO Exercise Walkthrough

The classical approach to object oriented programming is:

Write a textual description of the problem or exercise.
Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description.
Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.
The nouns are the classes and the verbs are the behaviors or methods.

Textual description:

Rock Paper Scissors is a two-player game in which both players make a move
simultaneously. There are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.  The
moves are then assessed to determine who wins or if there is a tie. 

Move comparisons (rules)
rock beats scissors
scissors beats paper
paper beats rock

If both players choose the same move, the game is a tie. 

Nouns: player, game, move, rule 
Verbs: choose, compare

Association:
players 
  choose
game
  compare (moves are compared to determine winner)
move
rule

Classes/methods:

class Player
  def initialize
  end 

  def choose
  end 
end

class Game
  def initialize
  end

  def compare
  end
end

class Move
  def initialize
  end
end

class Rule
  def initialize
  end
end

Orchestration engine:
(Possibly where compare and winner selection should be done)

class RPS_game
  def initialize
  end

  def play
  end
end 

Algorithm:
game play:
-welcome message
-player1 makes a move
-player2 makes a move
-a winner is decided and displayed
-continue (loop game) or quit

**
- instantiate game
- instantiate players
- players move
  - instantiate move?
- winner determined (by Game object?)
  - instantiate rule?
- display winner
- continue or quit
