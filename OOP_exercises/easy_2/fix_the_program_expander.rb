What is wrong with the following code? What fix(es) would you make?

class Expander
  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
  end

  def to_s
    self.expand(3)
  end

  private

  def expand(n)
    @string * n
  end
end

expander = Expander.new('xyz')
puts expander

=> The code is performing (I believe) as intended.  The issue with
versions of Ruby before 2.7 was that you could not call the
private method #expand with 'self.', but that is no longer the case.
