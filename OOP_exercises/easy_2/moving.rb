=begin
with the following code:
class Person
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

Modify so the following code works:

mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"

You are allowed to write only one method to do this.

=> We can create a Module Walkable to contain the #walk
method and include that module in these classes. Per the
name of the exercises, we might go as far as creating a
module Movable, if we anticipate other forms of movement
might be implemented.

module Walkable
  def walk
    puts "#{name} #{gait} forward"
  end
end

class Person
  include Walkable

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  include Walkable

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  include Walkable

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"
